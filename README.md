# lab.js studies

Here you can find some of the lab.js studies I built for Julian Keil. To modify or run them, just download the scripts and open them in the [lab.js builder](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/). If you have problems opening, modifying or running the studies or found a video of a cute animal you want to share with me (always appreciated!), feel free to write me an email (merle.schuckart@gmx.de) or a [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MerleSchuckart). I'm happy to help and always really thankful for ideas or suggestions for improving my studies!

If you'd like to start building studies in lab.js yourself, you can find really nice [tutorials](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/builder/index.html) on how to use the [builder](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/) online.


**Here's a short overview on which studies you can download here:**

You can download different versions of the [Sound Induced Flash Illusion](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/sound-induced-flash) with an additional n-back task (no-back, 0-back, 1-back and 2-back task) in [English](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/lab.js-studies/blob/master/SIFI_n-back_online_english) or [German](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/lab.js-studies/blob/master/SIFI_n-back_online_german) as online studies or in [German](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/lab.js-studies/blob/master/SIFI_n-back_lab_german) as a lab study. You can easily transform the English online study into a lab study as well.
